# ChimiaResearch

## Overview
ChimiaResearch is an innovative project that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a robotic chemist. This initiative is inspired by groundbreaking research detailed in papers such as "Autonomous chemical research with large language models" and "Organic synthesis in a modular robotic system driven by a chemical programming language". Our goal is to leverage the power of AI and robotics to revolutionize the field of chemical research, enabling faster, more efficient, and autonomous experimentation.

## Features
- AI-Driven Experimentation: Utilizing a Transformer-based LLM (like GPT-4) for experimental design and planning.
- Robotic Execution: A modular robotic system capable of synthesizing organic compounds.
- Integration with Existing Literature: Compatibility with a vast array of chemical synthesis literature.
- Autonomous Compiler: For translating chemical programming languages into executable robotic actions.
