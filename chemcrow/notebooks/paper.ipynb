       "The study introduces ChemCrow, an augmented large language model (LLM) chemistry agent that integrates 18 expert-designed computational chemistry tools to enhance LLM performance in tasks related to organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. ChemCrow demonstrates its capabilities by autonomously planning and executing syntheses of various compounds, including an insect repellent and organocatalysts, and by guiding the discovery of a novel chromophore. The agent's effectiveness is evaluated through both LLM and expert assessments, revealing its ability to automate diverse chemical tasks and its potential as a tool for both expert chemists and non-experts. The study also highlights the limitations of using GPT-4 alone for scientific applications, as it struggles with chemistry-related problems and lacks access to external knowledge sources. The publicly available code for ChemCrow can be found on GitHub, and the study emphasizes the importance of integrating computational tools into a single platform to overcome steep learning curves and fully exploit their potential."
