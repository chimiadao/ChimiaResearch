# ChemCrow-inspired LLM Chemistry Integration Tool

## Overview
Inspired by the groundbreaking work in "Augmenting large language models with chemistry tools", this repository is dedicated to advancing the integration of computational chemistry tools and large language models (LLMs). Our platform, akin to the ChemCrow project, focuses on enhancing LLM's capabilities in handling complex chemistry-related tasks, thereby bridging the gap between computational and experimental chemistry.

## Key Features
- Integration of Expert-Designed Tools: Incorporates 18 expert-designed chemistry tools to augment LLM performance in various chemistry domains.
- Diverse Application Scope: From organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials design, our tool is engineered to handle a wide range of chemical tasks.
- Autonomous Planning and Execution: Capable of autonomously planning and executing complex chemical syntheses and discovery processes.
- Expert and LLM Evaluations: Rigorous evaluation process involving both LLM and expert assessments to ensure accuracy and reliability.
